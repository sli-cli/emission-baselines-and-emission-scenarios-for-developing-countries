# Project Title

This project includes two main files for data analysis and modeling. The first file focuses on data cleaning and processing, including the calculation of median, maximum, and minimum values for visualizations. The second file involves model validation against real-world data and projections for future scenarios.

## Files Description

1. **File 1: Data Cleaning and Visualization**
   - This file includes the data cleaning process, where raw data is prepared for analysis.
   - It handles the calculation of key statistics such as median, maximum, and minimum values, which are used in the visualization.
   - Visualizations are generated to represent the cleaned data and statistical analysis.

2. **File 2: Model Validation and Future Scenarios**
   - This file compares the results from various models against real-world data to assess the accuracy of the models.
   - It includes future emission projections based on different scenarios.
   - The results from the models are analyzed and compared with actual data to highlight discrepancies and insights.
