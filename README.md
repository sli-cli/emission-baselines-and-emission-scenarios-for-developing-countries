# emission-baselines-and-emission-scenarios-for-developing-countries

This project includes two main files for data analysis and modeling. The first file focuses on filtering and processing of IAMs results, including the calculation of median, maximum, and minimum values for visualization of figures. The second file involves model validation against actual emissions and projections for future scenarios.

## Files Description

1. **File 1: data_clean_IAMs_analysis**
   - This file includes the data cleaning process, where raw data about IAMs is prepared for further analysis.
   - It handles the calculation of key statistics such as median, maximum, and minimum values, which are used in the visualization of figures.

2. **File 2: History_IAMs_scenarios**
   - This file compares the results from various models against actual emissions to assess the accuracy of the models.
   - It includes future emission projections based on different re-calculated scenarios.
   - It also includes inertia and excellence scenarios.
